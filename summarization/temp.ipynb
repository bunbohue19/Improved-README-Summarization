It lets you style an entire app in minutes.\\\\n\\\\nOut of the box, the styling looks like this:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIts easily modified, though. The styling above, for example, is declared . Here are examples of other themes that are defined :\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe styling is declared using a CSS-like syntax that supports variables:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNUI lets you:\\\\n\\\\n Update the visual appearance of an entire application in minutes\\\\n Save themes for use in multiple applications\\\\n Set the styles of UI elements using simple rules, like setting \\\\n Define variables like  or  (a la Sass/LESS)\\\\n Avoid digging through documentation to find how to change specific UI elements styling\\\\n Quickly create custom style classes\\\\n Modify an applications styling while it is running\\\\n\\\\nSome exciting features are on the horizon, and contributions are very encouraged. Please see the .\\\\n\\\\nInstallation\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\n### CocoaPods\\\\n\\\\nNUI is most easily installed using . Its pod name is \"NUI\". After installing it, add  to  in AppDelegate.m (like ).\\\\nWhen installed as a framework, NUI can be natively imported in Swift. Just add\\\\n to the top of your file.\\\\n\\\\n### Without CocoaPods\\\\n\\\\nIf you choose not to use CocoaPods, you can install NUI with these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Copy the NUI directory into your application\\\\n2. Add the CoreImage and QuartzCore frameworks to your application if you havent already (like )\\\\n3. Add  as a subproject, set its iOSNUIParse target as a dependency of your target, and add libNUIParse.a to your linked libraries.\\\\n4. Add  to  in AppDelegate.m (like )\\\\n5. To use NUI in Swift add  to your bridging header.\\\\n\\\\nThe Demo uses CocoaPods, so youll want to , run  in the  directory, and then open the .xcworkspace to open the project.\\\\n\\\\nUsage\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nHeres a .\\\\n\\\\nAfter dropping in NUI, you can modify your apps styling by simply editing NUIStyle.nss. If you want to avoid modifying NUIs files, you can copy NUIStyle.nss into your app, rename it (e.g. MyTheme.nss), then replace  with  (step 4 in Installation).\\\\n\\\\nDue to the nature of UIKits usage of simple UI components within more complex UI components, NUI doesnt style some UIKit components in some very rare cases. If you ever need to apply styling for these cases, you can simply use NUIRenderer:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis will use the Button style. You can also specify a custom class:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nN.B. NUI used to require that you make your elements inherit from a NUI class, but this is no longer the case. See \"Migrating From Subclasses To Categories\" below for details.\\\\n\\\\n### Editing The Style Rules\\\\n\\\\nNUIStyle.nss contains all of the style rules. A rule like  modifies the font name of every UIButton, for example.\\\\n\\\\nThe format should be self-explanatory, but here are some notes:\\\\n\\\\n Styling variables are defined at the top, but they can be added/modified/removed as you see fit.\\\\n You can make an element inherit from multiple style classes (see Creating Custom Style Classes below).\\\\n\\\\nTo see all of the available properties and values, see the Style Classes and Style Value Types lists below.\\\\n\\\\n### Creating Custom Style Classes\\\\n\\\\nYou can give elements custom style classes (e.g. ), and make those classes inherit from one or more other style classes by using the form . To bypass NUIs styling for a particular element, set the class to . You can set an elements style class either in Interface Builder or programmatically: \\\\n\\\\n#### Setting an Elements Style Class in Interface Builder\\\\n\\\\nTo do this, youll set a runtime attribute for the element (in Identity Inspector > User Defined Runtime Attributes, click ). Set the Key Path to , Type to , and Value to  (or :\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Setting an Elements Style Class Programmatically\\\\n\\\\nTo do this, youll want to import the NUI category for the element. If youre styling a UIButton, youd import:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can then set  on your element:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nN.B. A style class can inherit from an indefinite number of style rules, so if you want to create groups of style rules, you can set \\\\n\\\\n### Excluding Views from NUIs Styling\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to prevent specific view classes from being styled (e.g. third party UI elements that are already styled), you can specify these in NSS:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n will prevent NUI from applying the  style to views of the specified classes\\\\n*  will prevent NUI from applying the +[NUISettings setGlobalExclusions:][NUISettings init];@\"/path/to/Style.nss\"/Users/myusername/projects/ios/MyApp/Style.nssNUIButtonpageIndicatorTintColorcurrentPageIndicatorTintColortruefalsenonelinebezelroundedpaddingmargin1510 15#FF0000rgb(255,0,0)hsla(0.5, 0, 1.0, 0.5)redyellowclear[UIColor redColor]redsystemboldSystemitalicSystemblackSystemheavySystemlightSystemmediumSystemsemiboldSystemthinSystemultraLightSystem[UIImage imageNamed:name]MyImage.png-14.5-1,1nonesingle-linesingle-line-etchedleftrightcenteruppercaselowercasecapitalizenonetopcenterbottomfilldefaultdarklightalert`)\\\\n\\\\nFAQ\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n#### How can I contribute?\\\\n\\\\nContributers are extremely appreciated! NUI covers a lot of ground, but there are still a number of elements and properties that are unsupported. Adding support for new properties is easy (take a look at  for examples). There are also a number of exciting big features that on the  that are up for grabs. Were also always looking for new themes, so feel free to add those, too!\\\\n\\\\n#### What advantages does this have over UIAppearance?\\\\n\\\\nUIAppearance is alright, but its unintuitive, time-consuming, and it doesnt support either the granularity or number of style modifications that NUI does. Styling should be abstracted in a simple stylesheet with simple property definitions; you shouldnt have to stare at long, nested method calls and have to dig through Apples documentation every time you want to make a small styling modification.\\\\n\\\\n#### I have an app that uses NUI; can I add a link to it here?\\\\n\\\\nSure! Feel free to add it to .\\\\n\\\\n#### Do you know about Pixate?\\\\n\\\\nYep! Its unclear when it will be launched, it wont be free (in either meaning of the word, likely), and the jury is still out on how good of a product itll be. I prefer free, lightweight solutions.\\\\n\\\\n#### How is \"NUI\" pronounced?\\\\n\\\\n\"New-ee\".
